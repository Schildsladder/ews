# Mass produced landslide early warning system 
This project is the idea and funded by Mr Ahmad Marzuki, my role is to implement the concept and manufactured over 100 landslide sensor. This sensor works by sensing a crack in the wall, piezzo alarm will activate and alarm the residence if the crack exceed certain treshold. This simple sensor is sensitive to less than 10 micron of movement and powered by battery, it can work for up to one year, after that the battery needs replacement.

installed sensor:
